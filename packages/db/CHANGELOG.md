### Minor Changes

- 47075bc: Runs no longer fail with Playwright's "Executable doesn't exist … run npx playwright install" when a test browser is missing or half-downloaded. `sdods run` checks, before generating specs, that every browser its targets launch (chromium for `@api` targets too) finished downloading for the exact revision the workspace's Playwright uses. With `--install-browsers` or `SDODS_AUTO_INSTALL_BROWSERS=1` (set by the desktop app) it downloads what is missing into the cache the runner reads; otherwise it stops with the `sdods browsers install` command. `sdods browsers list` and `sdods doctor` use the same check.
  
  Stopping a run from the UI or API now ends the whole process tree (the CLI, Playwright, its workers and browsers) on Windows, macOS and Linux, and requires the editor role, like starting one. New `POST /api/runs/:id/rerun` (`{ scope: 'all' | 'failed', scenarios? }`) replays a run's full selection, only its failed scenarios, or named ones; runs now store the selection they were started with (`runs.params_json`). New `GET`/`PUT /api/me/preferences/:key` store per-user UI preferences (`user_preferences` table), used to remember the last run selection per workspace and project.

- 835d64c: Repository metadata moved to the YarlisAISolutions organisation: `repository.url` and `bugs.url` now point at https://github.com/YarlisAISolutions/SDODS, `sdods feedback` opens issues there, and the documented server image is `ghcr.io/yarlisaisolutions/sdods-server`.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 00f2d34: Account menu, profile and sessions in the web UI.
  
  - The sidebar footer is now an account menu: profile, password and sessions, preferences, API tokens, MCP clients, admin pages, theme (system, light, dark), feedback and sign out.
  - Settings gains Profile (display name, email, role, memberships), Password & sessions (change password with the current one, list and sign out other sessions) and Preferences (theme, default organization, workspace and project).
  - `@sdods/db`: migration `0009_user_profile` adds `users.display_name`; `listSessionsForUser`, `deleteSessionById`, and `deleteSessionsForUser(userId, { exceptToken })`.
  - `@sdods/server`: `PATCH /api/me`, `POST /api/me/password`, `GET /api/me/sessions`, `DELETE /api/me/sessions/:id`, `POST /api/me/sessions/revoke-others` (browser sessions only, never API tokens). `/api/auth/me` returns email, display name, last login, creation date and the current session id. `PATCH /api/users/:id` accepts `displayName`.
  - Web pages that called routes the server does not have now use the real ones: Recorder (job events, recorded spec via `GET /api/projects/:slug/recorded/:file`, convert with `kind: convert`), Environments (create and edit through `PUT .../envs/:name`, which now edits the file in place instead of rewriting it), Schedules (save, pause/resume, history), Integrations (`PUT .../integrations` validates before writing and merges MCP servers by name) and the Agents live log.
  - `sdods users set-role` rejects an unknown role instead of reporting success without changing anything.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 4975711: Process gates judge sharded runs, CLI-ingested runs record their verdict, and `@a11y` can audit every page (#176, #177).
  
  - `sdods report merge --process <name> [-p <slug>]` judges a process's gates on the merged shards: the pass rate and flaky count from the merged results, the `@a11y`/`@perf` evidence from the shards' run directories and the reports attached in the blobs. It prints the same gate table as `sdods run --process`, writes `gates.json` into the `--run` directory and exits 1 with `GATE_FAILED`. Without `--process`, a merge now also judges the process a shard's `run.json` names when that process declares gates.
  - `sdods report merge` merges several shard report directories, including blobs recorded under different checkouts (CI's Playwright container and its bare runner). `playwright merge-reports` reads one directory and refuses mixed test roots, so the reports are staged into one directory with a merge config that pins the root. Before this, CI's merge step failed with "too many arguments" and its `|| echo` hid it. A failed merge now shows Playwright's error rather than the tail of its stack.
  - Ingest records the process gate verdict under `totals_json.gates` and marks a gated-out run failed, for CLI, merged and server-started runs alike (`gates.json` in the run directory, or judged during `sdods report ingest` and server ingest when the run's process has gates). `RunRecord.gates` carries it, and the run page in the web UI shows the gate table.
  - `a11y.scope: final | every-page` (default `final`), overridable per environment. With `every-page`, the `@a11y` hook audits each distinct URL a step leaves the scenario on, after the page settles at the point the `@perf` hook reads it, skips URLs an explicit audit step covered, and fails once at the end naming each violating URL. `sdods/a11y-scenario` carries a `pages` list, and the `a11y` gate counts one audit per URL.

### Patch Changes

- 497222e: Dependencies moved to their latest compatible releases: zod 4.6, yaml 2.9.1, fastify 5.12.4, `@axe-core/playwright` 4.13 (axe-core 4.13 rules), `@anthropic-ai/sdk` 0.125, `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` 0.3.272, playwright-bdd 9.2.1 and tar 7.5.22. The installer now pins Bun 1.4.2.
  
  Tooling moves to TypeScript 6.0 and ESLint 10, and `fastify-plugin` to 6. Errors re-thrown from a caught failure (JSON bodies that do not parse after templating, GitHub evidence updates, an OpenAI-compatible server that does not answer) now carry the original error as `cause`.
  
  `sdods init` scaffolds projects on TypeScript 6.0, playwright-bdd 9.2.1 and tsx 4.23.13, and the workflow `sdods schedule` generates uses `actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-node@v7` and `actions/upload-artifact@v7`.

## 0.8.0

### Patch Changes

- 8611552: Run ingest no longer stores a skipped scenario as passed. A passing before or after hook counted as a pass, so a scenario whose Gherkin steps were all skipped (`@skip:<browser>`) was recorded as passed in the results database. Hooks now only fail a scenario; passed and skipped come from its Gherkin steps, as in the traceability reader.
- 8611552: A scenario that called `test.skip()` part-way is recorded as skipped, not passed, by run ingest and by `sdods report traceability`. playwright-bdd reports the steps before the skip as PASSED and the rest as SKIPPED, and both readers counted any passed step as a pass; the worst step result now wins, as in Cucumber.

### Minor Changes

- 097aead: `sdods users reset --yes` removes every user with their sessions, API tokens and memberships, so the next `sdods serve` offers the one-time `/setup` link again; projects, runs and schedules are kept. `sdods users set-password <username> --password <pw> [--activate]` sets a password from the terminal, signs the user out everywhere and can re-enable a deactivated account, so a locked-out sole admin no longer has to wipe the database. Both are audited. The docs gain a "Reinstall or reset" section for installed, clone, Docker and desktop setups.

### Minor Changes

- 4abc389: Projects can now be created, imported and deleted from the dashboard.
  
  - `sdods project delete <slug> --yes` moves a project to `.sdods/trash/<slug>-<timestamp>` so it can be restored by hand (`--purge` removes it outright). `DELETE /api/projects/:slug?confirm=<slug>` does the same from the web UI, after taking the project's schedules down — the scheduler arms every row it finds without checking that the project still exists, so schedules left behind would keep firing runs against a directory that is gone. The DB row is kept and flagged `archived`, because runs, results and insights all reference it.
  - `sdods project import <source>` registers an existing project from a directory, a `.zip` or a git URL, re-homing its `slug`/`organization`/`workspace` and leaving `.auth/` and `.env*` behind. `--dry-run` reports what it found without writing. `POST /api/projects/import` exposes it, with path and git sources limited to admins since they are read with the server's own credentials.
  - `sdods project create` takes `--description`, and `POST /api/projects` accepts it. That body is now strict: it silently dropped every field it did not name, so a project created from the web form lost its description, tags, routes, modules, processes and environments.
  - Creating a project now validates the target workspace against `sdods.workspace.yaml` as well as the database. A workspace that exists only in the database made `ProjectRegistry.discover` throw for *every* project on the next reload.
  - `VERSION` is read from the package manifest instead of a hand-maintained constant. It had drifted to 0.2.2 while the packages were at 0.3.2, and `sdods init` writes `^${VERSION}` into every scaffolded workspace — where a caret does not cross a 0.x minor, pinning those workspaces to a CLI far behind the server talking to it.
  - `GET /api/health` reports the capabilities of the CLI the server spawns, so the dashboard can explain that an action needs `sdods upgrade --apply` instead of surfacing `unknown command`.
