 * The one switch for asking people to sponsor SDODS. While it is false nothing offers a payment:
 * the sites hide the sponsor page, nav, footer and support prompts, and the web UI, CLI help,
 * desktop menu, installer, README and FUNDING.yml say nothing about sponsorship.
 *
 * Turn it on only once the "SDODS Developers" Stripe account and its Payment Links exist (see
 * apps/www/lib/sponsor.ts). The installer scripts and the desktop menu cannot import this package
 * and keep their own copy; tests/sponsor.test.ts fails if any copy disagrees.
