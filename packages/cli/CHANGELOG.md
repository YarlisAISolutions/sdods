## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- f85227d: Playwright 1.64. The browser tools gain `browser_emulate_media` (color scheme, reduced motion,
  forced colors, contrast, media type) and the new upstream arguments: `browser_find` `maxResults` and
  `filename`, `browser_tabs` `isolatedContext`, `browser_start_video` `fps` and `cursor`, and
  `browser_video_show_actions` `style`. Tag expressions use `@cucumber/tag-expressions` in place of
  the deprecated `cucumber-tag-expressions`, so installs no longer print a deprecation warning. The CI
  image, the installers and the Docker images pin Bun 1.4.3.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- b98156e: `sdods run` has its own console output. Each scenario is one line, `[n/total] ✔ Feature › Scenario
  [ui · chromium] (1.2s)`, in place of the runner's generated spec paths and hook lines. Failures
  show the feature file, the error (without generated-spec code or browser launch logs), the failure
  screenshot, the video and `sdods trace <zip>`. `run --list` lists scenarios by title. New `--open
  always|on-failure|never` (or `SDODS_OPEN`) opens the SDODS dashboard after a run; by default only
  on failure at an interactive terminal, never in CI or under a coding agent. The web UI puts the
  SDODS dashboard first and labels the HTML report and trace viewer as Playwright's.

### Patch Changes

- 357cd91: `sdods run` no longer ends with the runner's "To open last HTML report run: npx playwright
  show-report" hint. It prints the SDODS command to open the results instead, and `sdods trace --run
  <id>` after a failure. Every runner and generator invocation (`run`, `watch`, `lint`, `steps list`,
  `record`, `auth capture`, `trace`, `show-report`, `report merge`, `browsers install`) now resolves
  the workspace's own package instead of a bare `npx`, which could prompt to download a package or
  fetch an unrelated one. `watch`, `record` and `auth capture` check for missing browsers up front
  and name `sdods browsers install`; `doctor --fix` and `init` install browsers through the same
  path. GitHub failure issues name `sdods trace <zip>`. `show-report` accepts `--last`. `sdods
  --help` credits Playwright and playwright-bdd.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 70eb49d: `sdods run` and `sdods watch` run bddgen through Node from the workspace's installed `playwright-bdd` instead of `npx bddgen`. Where npx finds no `node_modules/.bin` shim it recognises (bun installs on Windows), it downloaded the unrelated registry package `bddgen@1.0.5` and every run failed with "bddgen failed to generate specs".

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 47075bc: Runs no longer fail with Playwright's "Executable doesn't exist … run npx playwright install" when a test browser is missing or half-downloaded. `sdods run` checks, before generating specs, that every browser its targets launch (chromium for `@api` targets too) finished downloading for the exact revision the workspace's Playwright uses. With `--install-browsers` or `SDODS_AUTO_INSTALL_BROWSERS=1` (set by the desktop app) it downloads what is missing into the cache the runner reads; otherwise it stops with the `sdods browsers install` command. `sdods browsers list` and `sdods doctor` use the same check.
  
  Stopping a run from the UI or API now ends the whole process tree (the CLI, Playwright, its workers and browsers) on Windows, macOS and Linux, and requires the editor role, like starting one. New `POST /api/runs/:id/rerun` (`{ scope: 'all' | 'failed', scenarios? }`) replays a run's full selection, only its failed scenarios, or named ones; runs now store the selection they were started with (`runs.params_json`). New `GET`/`PUT /api/me/preferences/:key` store per-user UI preferences (`user_preferences` table), used to remember the last run selection per workspace and project.

## 0.11.3

### Patch Changes

- c1f175b: Fix `sdods` failing to start on Windows with `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`: the bin shim now imports its entry point as a `file://` URL. This also unblocks the desktop app's first-run install on Windows.
  
  `sdods init` now adds `@axe-core/playwright` to the workspace, so the demo project's `@a11y` scenario passes on a fresh install instead of failing with "Accessibility audits need @axe-core/playwright".

## 0.11.0

### Patch Changes

- 00f2d34: Account menu, profile and sessions in the web UI.
  
  - The sidebar footer is now an account menu: profile, password and sessions, preferences, API tokens, MCP clients, admin pages, theme (system, light, dark), feedback and sign out.
  - Settings gains Profile (display name, email, role, memberships), Password & sessions (change password with the current one, list and sign out other sessions) and Preferences (theme, default organization, workspace and project).
  - `@sdods/db`: migration `0009_user_profile` adds `users.display_name`; `listSessionsForUser`, `deleteSessionById`, and `deleteSessionsForUser(userId, { exceptToken })`.
  - `@sdods/server`: `PATCH /api/me`, `POST /api/me/password`, `GET /api/me/sessions`, `DELETE /api/me/sessions/:id`, `POST /api/me/sessions/revoke-others` (browser sessions only, never API tokens). `/api/auth/me` returns email, display name, last login, creation date and the current session id. `PATCH /api/users/:id` accepts `displayName`.
  - Web pages that called routes the server does not have now use the real ones: Recorder (job events, recorded spec via `GET /api/projects/:slug/recorded/:file`, convert with `kind: convert`), Environments (create and edit through `PUT .../envs/:name`, which now edits the file in place instead of rewriting it), Schedules (save, pause/resume, history), Integrations (`PUT .../integrations` validates before writing and merges MCP servers by name) and the Agents live log.
  - `sdods users set-role` rejects an unknown role instead of reporting success without changing anything.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 4975711: Process gates judge sharded runs, CLI-ingested runs record their verdict, and `@a11y` can audit every page (#176, #177).
  
  - `sdods report merge --process <name> [-p <slug>]` judges a process's gates on the merged shards: the pass rate and flaky count from the merged results, the `@a11y`/`@perf` evidence from the shards' run directories and the reports attached in the blobs. It prints the same gate table as `sdods run --process`, writes `gates.json` into the `--run` directory and exits 1 with `GATE_FAILED`. Without `--process`, a merge now also judges the process a shard's `run.json` names when that process declares gates.
  - `sdods report merge` merges several shard report directories, including blobs recorded under different checkouts (CI's Playwright container and its bare runner). `playwright merge-reports` reads one directory and refuses mixed test roots, so the reports are staged into one directory with a merge config that pins the root. Before this, CI's merge step failed with "too many arguments" and its `|| echo` hid it. A failed merge now shows Playwright's error rather than the tail of its stack.
  - Ingest records the process gate verdict under `totals_json.gates` and marks a gated-out run failed, for CLI, merged and server-started runs alike (`gates.json` in the run directory, or judged during `sdods report ingest` and server ingest when the run's process has gates). `RunRecord.gates` carries it, and the run page in the web UI shows the gate table.
  - `a11y.scope: final | every-page` (default `final`), overridable per environment. With `every-page`, the `@a11y` hook audits each distinct URL a step leaves the scenario on, after the page settles at the point the `@perf` hook reads it, skips URLs an explicit audit step covered, and fails once at the end naming each violating URL. `sdods/a11y-scenario` carries a `pages` list, and the `a11y` gate counts one audit per URL.

### Patch Changes

- 497222e: Dependencies moved to their latest compatible releases: zod 4.6, yaml 2.9.1, fastify 5.12.4, `@axe-core/playwright` 4.13 (axe-core 4.13 rules), `@anthropic-ai/sdk` 0.125, `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` 0.3.272, playwright-bdd 9.2.1 and tar 7.5.22. The installer now pins Bun 1.4.2.
  
  Tooling moves to TypeScript 6.0 and ESLint 10, and `fastify-plugin` to 6. Errors re-thrown from a caught failure (JSON bodies that do not parse after templating, GitHub evidence updates, an OpenAI-compatible server that does not answer) now carry the original error as `cause`.
  
  `sdods init` scaffolds projects on TypeScript 6.0, playwright-bdd 9.2.1 and tsx 4.23.13, and the workflow `sdods schedule` generates uses `actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-node@v7` and `actions/upload-artifact@v7`.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 47ac9e2: `@a11y` and `@perf` now run, and process gates are evaluated.
  
  - `@a11y`: at the end of a UI or hybrid scenario, the page it ended on is audited with axe-core (WCAG 2.x A and AA). The scenario fails on any violation at or above the new `a11y.failOn` setting (`serious` by default). `a11y.include` and `a11y.exclude` scope the audit, and an environment can override each key. The result is attached as `sdods/a11y-scenario`. A URL that an explicit whole-page audit step already checked is not audited again.
  - `@perf`: every document the scenario loads records its vitals once it has loaded and painted. At the end of the scenario, each recording is compared with the page budgets in `perf.budgets`, and the p95 of the scenario's live API calls (plus any latency samples) is compared with `apiP95Ms`. The scenario fails in four cases: a budget is breached, a budgeted vital is unmeasured, no budgets are configured (`CONFIG_INVALID`), or no budget applies to anything the scenario measured. The result is attached as `sdods/perf-scenario`.
  - `sdods run --process <name>` evaluates `gates.minPassRate`, `gates.maxFlaky`, `gates.a11y` and `gates.perfBudgets` after the run and prints a gate table. When a gate fails, it exits 1 with the new error code `GATE_FAILED`. The a11y and perf gates also fail when nothing was audited or judged. The verdict is written to `gates.json`, `summary.json` and the `--json` output. The server's run manager records it on the run under `totals_json.gates` and marks a gated-out run failed. Gates are not evaluated on a single shard.
  - The axe audit and the vitals and budget helpers moved out of the step files into `a11y/audit.ts` and `perf/vitals.ts`, so the hooks can use them without registering the steps a second time. The step files still re-export them.
- dd24cdb: User pools no longer starve workers silently (#153).
  
  - `sdods run` stops before generating specs when a selected `@user:<role>` has fewer pool accounts than the scenarios of that role the workers could run at once. It exits `2` with `USER_POOL_TOO_SMALL` and names the role, the account count and the worker count. The count follows the selection (`--layer`, `--browser`, `--tags`, `--module`, `--feature`, `--since`, tag-gate skips, serial files, shards) and is skipped for `mode: shared`, `leaseScope: scenario`, database or OpenAPI datasets, `--list`, `--ui` and `--debug`. `--allow-pool-contention` runs anyway. `sdods doctor` prints accounts per role against the worker count (`-w` to set it).
  - `data.userPool.leaseScope: scenario | worker` (default `worker`, unchanged). With `scenario` an account is released when each scenario ends, including accounts leased by the `I use a leased user …` steps, so one account serialises its scenarios instead of starving whole workers. In that mode `waitMs` defaults to `leaseTtlMs`, and the time spent waiting is added to the scenario's timeout.
  - Waiters for a role are served in arrival order, so a worker that just released an account no longer wins it straight back.
  - **Removed:** `data.userPool.leaseStore: db`. It was accepted and never implemented, so sharded runs that relied on it did not share leases. It is now a configuration error ("leaseStore 'db' was never implemented; use 'file' (see #153)"); use `file`, or give each runner its own accounts.
  - `data.userPool.waitMs` is now optional in the schema (its effective default is unchanged for `leaseScope: worker`).
  - Fix: the shard offset in lease owners used `--workers ?? 1`, so with Playwright's default worker count a worker on shard 2 could share an owner with one on shard 1.
- 3fb1773: Visual baselines you review before they change, per-baseline masks, and Linux baselines from CI.
  
  - `screenshots.maxDiffPixelRatio` (default `0.01`, previously hard-coded) and `screenshots.baselines.<name>` with its own `mask` (added to `screenshots.mask`) and `maxDiffPixelRatio`, in the project or an environment.
  - New step `the page should match the visual baseline {string} masking {string}` with comma-separated selectors.
  - A failed visual check keeps its expected, actual and diff images and a `<name>.failure.json` record under the scenario's `visual/<run target>/` directory, so they survive the CI artifact upload.
  - `sdods baselines diff [--run <id>]` lists failed visual checks; `sdods baselines accept <name…> --run <id>` (or `--all`) copies the actual screenshot to `features/__screenshots__/<run target>/<platform>/` for the platform the run happened on. `sdods run --update-snapshots` still works and now warns that it overwrites without review.
  - Server: `GET /api/runs/:id/baselines` and `POST /api/runs/:id/baselines/accept` (`features:write`, editor role); the web UI shows **Accept as baseline** with the diff on a failed visual step.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- f950986: GitHub issues can embed evidence that renders inline in private repositories (#82). With `integrations.github.evidence.host: branch` (off by default), screenshots, `video.webm` and a GIF preview (when ffmpeg is on PATH) go to an orphan `sdods-evidence` branch through the git data API, in one fast-forward commit per run that is retried when another job moved the branch first, and are embedded as `blob/<branch>/<path>?raw=true`. The evidence can go to a separate repository with its own token (`evidence.repo`, `evidence.tokenEnv`). Per-file and per-run size caps apply (`maxFileBytes` 5 MB, `maxRunBytes` 25 MB), and files over them are listed in the issue. `sdods integrations test` checks that the token can push to the evidence repository, and `sdods integrations evidence prune [--older-than 14d]` rewrites the branch without old runs. Traces are never uploaded.
- 00930d0: `sdods load -p <project> -e <env> <profile>` runs API load tests through k6. A profile in `projects/<slug>/load/<profile>.yaml` lists requests (method, path relative to `api.baseUrl`, headers, body, expected status and body checks) with k6 `stages` or `vus`/`duration` and `thresholds`. SDODS generates a k6 script whose credentials come from the environment's `api.auth` as `__ENV` lookups, never inlined, prints the target URL and peak virtual users, runs `k6 run --summary-export` (or the `grafana/k6` image with `--runner docker`) and exits `1` when thresholds fail. Load is opt-in: an environment must set `load.allowed: true`, `load.maxVus` caps the peak, and write methods need `load.allowWrites: true`. `--dry-run` writes the script without k6. Results land in `.sdods/runs/<id>/load/<profile>/`.
- 509b2c8: Role matrices (#118): declare an actor × surface grid once in `projects/<slug>/roles.matrix.yaml` and generate the Scenario Outline examples from it.
  
  - `@sdods/contracts`: `RolesMatrixFileSchema` and `ROLES_MATRIX_FILE`. A matrix lists its `roles`, a `default` outcome, optional `outcomes` and `title`, and `rows` whose extra keys are Examples columns; `expect` is one outcome or a per-role map.
  - `@sdods/core`: `loadRolesMatrices`, `expandFeatureText` and `planMatrixExpansion`. A `Scenario Outline` tagged `@matrix:<name>` gets one `Examples:` block per role, tagged `@user:<role>`, between `# sdods:matrix:begin/end` markers; re-running is idempotent and hand-written Examples are kept. `sdods lint` accepts `@matrix:<name>` and reports an unknown matrix (`tags/matrix`), an invalid matrix file or undeclared role, a misplaced template or unknown placeholder, an out-of-date feature (`matrix/stale`, warning), and a matrix role with no user-pool account in an environment (`matrix/unseeded-role`, warning).
  - `@sdods/cli`: `sdods matrix expand [-p <slug>] [--check] [--dry-run]`; `--check` exits 3 when a feature is out of date, for CI.
  - `@sdods/mcp`: `matrix_expand` stages the expanded features as a proposal instead of writing them. The conventions list `@matrix:<name>` among the value tags.
- 85ac708: Requirement traceability (#119). A new value tag `@req:<id>` links a scenario to a requirement; it may repeat, and on a `Feature` or `Rule` it applies to every scenario under it. The id is opaque. An optional `traceability:` block in `sdods.project.yaml` (`requirements`: a YAML or CSV list of ids and titles, `link`: a URL template with `{id}`, `require`: boolean) makes lint reject ids missing from the list (`tags/req`) and, with `require: true`, scenarios without a `@req:` tag (`tags/req-missing`).
  
  `sdods report traceability -p <slug> [-e <env>] [--run <id> | --last] [--format json|csv|md|html] [-o <file>]` exports requirement → scenarios (feature, line, name, tags) → final result per runner project in the chosen run (status, browser, attempts, flaky, duration, timestamps), with the run's id, environment, commit and SDODS version, a coverage summary (passed / failed / not run / not covered) and an empty sign-off block that SDODS never fills in. It reads `messages.ndjson` from the run directory, falling back to per-scenario `meta.json`; no database or server is needed. `@sdods/core/analyze` exports `buildTraceabilityReport` and `renderTraceability`.
  
  The agent conventions (`@sdods/mcp` `CONVENTIONS`) list `@req:<id>` among the optional value tags.

### Patch Changes

- 8611552: `sdods report merge <dirs...> --run <id>` now writes into that run. The parent `report` command also defines `--run`, and Commander handed the option to it, so `merge` silently fell back to the latest run (or failed with "No run to merge into").
- 8611552: `sdods integrations evidence prune --older-than` accepts `min`, `h`, `d` and `w` (a bare number is days) and refuses `m`, which read as minutes: `--older-than 3m` meant as three months pruned almost every run. The error suggests `min` or `d`.
- 8611552: `sdods matrix expand --file <path>` without `-p` no longer also plans the file under a project whose folder name is a prefix of the right one (`projects/shop` for a file in `projects/shop-admin`).
- 0cc05cb: Per-scenario browser emulation: `@locale:<bcp47>`, `@timezone:<IANA>`, `@theme:<light|dark|no-preference>`, `@viewport:<W>x<H>` and `@device:<name>` set the browser context before it opens, over the environment's `use:` block, on a Scenario, a Feature, a Rule or one `Examples:` block. `sdods lint` validates the values. New steps: `I use the locale {string}`, `I use the timezone {string}`, `I use the {string} color scheme`, `I use the viewport {int} by {int}`, `I use the device {string}`, `the page should reflow without horizontal scrolling`, `the page should have no untranslated keys` and `the page should have no untranslated keys matching {string}`.
  
  Fix: `mobile-chrome` and `mobile-safari` run targets ran in a 1280x720 window instead of the device's viewport, because the generated project set `viewport: undefined`, which Playwright reads as "use the default".
  
  The agent rule lines (`CONVENTIONS` in `@sdods/mcp`, the `sdods` skill in `@sdods/cli`) list the new tags.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 5b69426: SDODS for AI coding tools.
  
  - `sdods skills list` and `sdods skills install [--agent claude,agents,cursor,copilot,gemini] [--global]` copy the bundled Agent Skills (`sdods`, `sdods-run`, `sdods-record`, `sdods-start-ui`) to where Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot and Gemini CLI read them; `npx -y @sdods/cli skills install` needs no global install. `sdods init` installs the same set into `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills`, and no longer copies SDODS's own release skills.
  - `sdods mcp install gemini` writes `.gemini/settings.json`.
  - Every stdio snippet now launches `npx -y @sdods/cli mcp`. `npx sdods mcp` pointed at a package that does not exist, so clients configured from `mcp install --file`, `agent install`, the web UI or `/api/mcp/info` failed with CONNECTION_CLOSED outside a checkout.
  - `sdods mcp install claude|codex --http-url` passes the bearer token (`${SDODS_TOKEN}` / `--bearer-token-env-var SDODS_TOKEN`); before, both registered a server that answered 401.
  - `sdods mcp install windsurf` writes Windsurf's real config, `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`, with `serverUrl` for remote servers.

### Patch Changes

- a4e660d: SDODS can now be sponsored. sdods.com/sponsor takes one-time or monthly sponsorships through Stripe, in any amount, and companies can ask for an invoice or a bank transfer. `sdods --help`, the installer's closing notes, the web UI sidebar and the desktop app's SDODS menu each link to that page.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 097aead: `sdods users reset --yes` removes every user with their sessions, API tokens and memberships, so the next `sdods serve` offers the one-time `/setup` link again; projects, runs and schedules are kept. `sdods users set-password <username> --password <pw> [--activate]` sets a password from the terminal, signs the user out everywhere and can re-enable a deactivated account, so a locked-out sole admin no longer has to wipe the database. Both are audited. The docs gain a "Reinstall or reset" section for installed, clone, Docker and desktop setups.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 45a38a8: Stop publishing Playwright traces, and redact the ones a run keeps (#101).
  
  A `trace.zip` records every request's `Cookie`/`Authorization` headers, `Set-Cookie` responses, the context's `storageState` (cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB — where Firebase keeps its refresh token) and typed values, so for projects with pool accounts it carries live sessions.
  
  - **Integrations never upload, attach or link a trace.** GitHub issues no longer link `trace.zip` through `SDODS_PUBLIC_URL` or the CI artifacts page, and `uploadToRelease` no longer uploads it; Jira no longer attaches it. Both name the trace's local path under a warning that it contains credentials, with the `npx playwright show-trace` command. The video is still linked or uploaded (it shows the screen, not headers or storage).
  - **`sdods run` redacts every trace after the run**, before ingest and integrations: `runner-output/**/trace.zip`, the HTML report's copies under `html-report/data/`, zips nested in blob shard reports, and the BASE64 trace bodies embedded in `messages.ndjson` (which ingest turns back into `trace.zip`). Credential headers (`Cookie`, `Set-Cookie`, `Authorization`, `Proxy-Authorization`, `X-Api-Key` and similar), cookie values, localStorage/sessionStorage/IndexedDB values, `httpCredentials` passwords, password inputs in DOM snapshots and values typed into password/secret/token fields become `[redacted]`. Other entries are copied through unchanged and the trace viewer opens the result. Request/response bodies and page text are not redacted.
  - New `evidence.redactTraces` (default `true`; env files may override it). `evidence.trace` and `sdods run --trace <mode>` already control whether traces are recorded at all.
  - Docs warn that traces are credential-bearing (GitHub and Jira guide, `sdods trace`, `project.yaml` reference).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 912569e: Enabled integrations now act on `sdods run`, and GitHub issues from failures carry video and trace, survive a fresh CI runner and have their labels checked.
  
  - `sdods run` publishes the finished run to every enabled integration (check runs, PR comment, issues per `createIssueOnFailure`) through the same code path as `sdods integrations notify`. `integrations.github.createIssueOnFailure` used to do nothing unless a separate notify step existed. `--no-notify` opts out; cancelled runs, runs with no scenario results and sharded runs do not notify. A notify failure is printed as a warning and never changes the exit code, and `--json` output reports the outcome under `notify`.
  - GitHub issue bodies link the failing attempt's `video.webm` and `trace.zip` from `runner-output/`, read from `runner-results.json`, with the `npx playwright show-trace` command. `uploadToRelease` uploads them with their real content type instead of `image/png`.
  - Before creating an issue, the GitHub provider searches the repository for an open issue carrying `sdods-fingerprint:<fingerprint>` and comments on it, so a runner without `.sdods/issue-links.json` no longer opens a duplicate. Notifying the same run twice no longer comments twice.
  - `sdods integrations test` fails when a configured GitHub label does not exist in the repository and names the missing labels; `--create-labels` creates them.
- f179b8e: Trace, video, parallelism and a setup tier are now configurable instead of hard-coded in the runner config.
  
  - `evidence: { trace, video, screenshot }` in `sdods.project.yaml`, overridable per key in `envs/<env>.yaml`, with `sdods run --trace <mode>` / `--video <mode>` and `SDODS_TRACE` / `SDODS_VIDEO` on top. Values are Playwright's modes and are validated. Defaults are unchanged (`on-first-retry`, `retain-on-failure`, `off`); with `retries.local: 0` the old default meant no trace locally, so `--trace on` is now the way to get one without forcing a retry.
  - `fullyParallel` (default `true`) per project and per process. `false` keeps the scenarios of a feature file in order.
  - `setup: { tags: '@setup' }` per project, or per process (`setup: false` to turn it off): each run target gets a `<target>--setup` companion that runs the matching scenarios first, in the same browser, and the target depends on it, so the rest of the run does not start when a probe or login fails. Setup scenarios ignore `--tags` and run once.
  - `parseRunnerProjectName` reads the new `<project>--<layer>[--<browser>]--setup` names as their real layer and browser with `phase: 'setup'`.
  - A config value that is invalid only after `${VAR}`, `SDODS_*` or CLI overrides now fails with a configuration error naming the path instead of a raw validation error.

### Patch Changes

- 33416fd: Cucumber messages record which step passed or failed again.
  
  On Playwright below 1.63, a workspace that installs SDODS from npm recorded every Gherkin step `SKIPPED` in `messages.ndjson` (and the cucumber HTML report), with failures attached to a hook. playwright-bdd matches a step's result by its line in the generated spec, and those Playwright versions report the line in their transformed copy instead. Measured on 1.60.0, 1.61.1, 1.62.0 and 1.62.1 against 1.63.0.
  
  - `@playwright/test` 1.63.0 is now the floor: `sdods init` scaffolds `^1.63.0`, `@sdods/core` declares `>=1.63` as its peer range, and the server image uses `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.63.0-noble`.
  - `sdods run` warns and `sdods doctor` fails a "step results" check when the workspace resolves an older `@playwright/test`, and both name the upgrade command.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 4abc389: A run that executes no scenarios now fails instead of passing.
  
  - `sdods run` exits `2` when the selection matches nothing, and says so. Zero scenarios with exit `0` looked exactly like a green run, so a mistyped `--tags` or `--feature` kept CI passing while testing nothing. One shard of several may still come back empty, and `--allow-empty` restores the old behaviour for a run that is expected to select nothing.
  - A malformed tag expression (`--tags "@smoke and ("`) is a configuration error (exit `2`) naming the expression, raised before specs are generated; it used to crash bddgen with a stack trace and a hint about undefined steps.
  - `--feature` must name a feature file in the project. It accepts a path relative to `features/`, to the project, to the repository, or an absolute one; a path that does not exist is refused instead of selecting nothing.
  - `sdods features list --tags` evaluates full tag expressions, the same way `sdods run` does. It compared the whole expression to each tag, so `@ui and @smoke` listed nothing.
- 4abc389: Projects can now be created, imported and deleted from the dashboard.
  
  - `sdods project delete <slug> --yes` moves a project to `.sdods/trash/<slug>-<timestamp>` so it can be restored by hand (`--purge` removes it outright). `DELETE /api/projects/:slug?confirm=<slug>` does the same from the web UI, after taking the project's schedules down — the scheduler arms every row it finds without checking that the project still exists, so schedules left behind would keep firing runs against a directory that is gone. The DB row is kept and flagged `archived`, because runs, results and insights all reference it.
  - `sdods project import <source>` registers an existing project from a directory, a `.zip` or a git URL, re-homing its `slug`/`organization`/`workspace` and leaving `.auth/` and `.env*` behind. `--dry-run` reports what it found without writing. `POST /api/projects/import` exposes it, with path and git sources limited to admins since they are read with the server's own credentials.
  - `sdods project create` takes `--description`, and `POST /api/projects` accepts it. That body is now strict: it silently dropped every field it did not name, so a project created from the web form lost its description, tags, routes, modules, processes and environments.
  - Creating a project now validates the target workspace against `sdods.workspace.yaml` as well as the database. A workspace that exists only in the database made `ProjectRegistry.discover` throw for *every* project on the next reload.
  - `VERSION` is read from the package manifest instead of a hand-maintained constant. It had drifted to 0.2.2 while the packages were at 0.3.2, and `sdods init` writes `^${VERSION}` into every scaffolded workspace — where a caret does not cross a 0.x minor, pinning those workspaces to a CLI far behind the server talking to it.
  - `GET /api/health` reports the capabilities of the CLI the server spawns, so the dashboard can explain that an action needs `sdods upgrade --apply` instead of surfacing `unknown command`.

  - `@playwright/test` 1.63.0 is now the floor: `sdods init` scaffolds `^1.63.0`, `@sdods/core` declares `>=1.63` as its peer range, and the server image uses `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.63.0-noble`.
  - `sdods run` warns and `sdods doctor` fails a "step results" check when the workspace resolves an older `@playwright/test`, and both name the upgrade command.
- 4abc389: Close access-control holes in the server and in agent jobs.
  
  - Run ids `.` and `..` are refused. The router decodes `%2E%2E` before the id check ran, so `GET /api/runs/%2E%2E/files/sdods.db` returned the platform database to anyone with `artifacts:read`.
  - Run files, trees, comparisons, artifacts and HTML reports check the caller's workspace role for the run's project (from the database, a live job, or the run's `run.json`). `/reports/*` sat outside `/api/` and needed no session at all. Ingest refuses to write into a run, or file a manifest under a project, the caller cannot edit.
  - HTML, SVG and XML served from run directories carry `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` and `nosniff`, so an uploaded page runs with an opaque origin instead of the viewer's session. Uploaded `artifacts.tgz` archives can no longer write `html-report/`, which is served unsandboxed because the Playwright report needs `localStorage`.
  - The auth gate matches the routed path. `/%61pi/tokens` reached `/api/tokens` while skipping authentication and the CSRF check.
  - Sign-ins are throttled per username as well as per IP. `trustProxy` is now `SDODS_TRUST_PROXY` (default `false`); it was always on, so a forged `X-Forwarded-For` gave every guess a fresh address. The Cloud Run deploy sets it to `true`.
  - Agent job `plan` and `spec` must be regular files inside the project, outside dotfiles and hidden directories. They were read verbatim, so `spec: "/proc/self/environ"` streamed the server's environment back through the job log.
  - Agent CLIs (claude-code, codex) start the sdods MCP server without the `agents` capability and disallow `proposal_accept` / `proposal_reject`, so a job can no longer accept its own proposal. Claude Code is limited to the role's tools. Playwright's own MCP server is no longer attached by default, and the bridge used by the OpenAI-compatible and Ollama adapters drops `browser_run_code_unsafe`, `browser_run_code` and `browser_evaluate` from it.
  - `sdods config show` (plain, `--json`, `--explain`) masks header-auth values and credential-looking headers such as `X-Api-Key`; `--explain` reads from the same redacted tree instead of a weaker regex of its own.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 560e20d: Four tags the runner validated and then ignored now actually do something.
  
  `@env:`, `@skip:<browser>` and `@flag:` were checked at lint time and had no
  runtime path at all — the linter confirmed the tag was spelled correctly and the
  runner ignored it, so a project could carry hundreds of `@env:` tags and still
  point every one of them at production. `@quarantine` was not a tag this
  framework knew about, so every recipe excluded it by hand in a tag expression
  that drifts and that nobody can audit centrally.
  
  `scenarioSkipReason()` is a pure function in `config/tags.ts`, applied by a new
  automatic fixture declared first in test scope — so a scenario is excluded
  before an account is leased, a browser context is built, or a session is minted.
  The reason is recorded as an annotation as well as a skip, because a report that
  says "skipped" without saying why is how parked scenarios go unnoticed.
  
  `@flag:` gates only when the environment declares a flag list. An absent list
  means "not known", and a gate that fails closed on missing metadata would
  silently skip an entire suite.
  
  `sdods run --since <range>` selects only the features a git range could have
  broken, using the `analyzeChangeImpact` mapping that already existed and was
  reachable only through MCP. When nothing is impacted it says so and runs
  nothing, rather than running everything or exiting green on an empty run.
- 01b5c6e: Five new step libraries, and a publish path that cannot ship a stale build.
  
  `a11y.steps.ts` runs a real axe-core audit through `@axe-core/playwright` and adds
  the structural checks a rule engine cannot make — heading outline, alt text,
  per-rule isolation. `gates.a11y` and the `@a11y` tag stop being schema-only.
  
  `perf.steps.ts` wires the previously inert `PerfBudgetsSchema`: `pageLoadMs`,
  `lcpMs`, `fcpMs`, `ttfbMs` from real web-vitals, and `apiP95Ms` from sampled
  request latency.
  
  `net.steps.ts` adds download capture (filename, content type, CSV rows, JSON path)
  and SSE/streaming assertions. `dom.steps.ts` adds focus trapping, dialog and
  popover state, and keyboard navigation. `browser.steps.ts` adds cookies, storage,
  viewport and colour-scheme control, and console-error capture.
  
  Every step that quantifies over a set fails when the set is empty. "Every image
  has an alt" over a page with no images is silence, not a pass, and silence is what
  makes an accessibility suite worthless.
  
  `scripts/publish-npm.sh` now builds clean instead of relying on incremental
  `tsc -b`, and refuses to publish a package whose staged `dist/` is older than its
  `src/`. `@sdods/core@0.2.2` shipped `apiContext.auth = undefined` while its source
  said `auth = null`; because the publish loop skips versions already on the
  registry, that tarball can never be corrected at that version.

### Patch Changes

- 949b455: Seven analyzer and auth-strategy defects, each of which stated something false with confidence.
  
  `detectPackageManager` now walks up to the workspace root, so scanning a member
  directory of a monorepo no longer reports `unknown` / `monorepo: false`.
  
  Base URLs are ranked by how specifically the variable NAME claims to be the base
  URL, instead of first-wins by file order — `SIM_AGENT_API_URL` no longer beats
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` from 39 lines above it.
  
  An express dependency no longer forces `api = ui`: the `.listen()` port is only
  trusted when it names a different origin, so a full-stack app falls through to
  `ui + '/api'` as intended.
  
  Gitignored `.env*` files are skipped rather than read and republished into the
  report. `.env.example` no longer outranks a real environment for base URLs.
  
  `detectAuth` breaks ties by an explicit precedence and reports the ambiguity —
  with an epsilon, because these scores are sums of decimal weights and an exact
  `===` would call a 2e-16 difference a clear winner.
  
  `sdods analyze` gains `--max-files` / `--max-depth`, and the default file budget
  rises from 8,000 to 25,000: a single real app was 6,400 files, so the walk
  truncated before reaching `.github/` and then reported "no CI" as a fact.
  
  The `sso` and `token` auth strategies throw with a hint instead of silently
  returning no browser session.
