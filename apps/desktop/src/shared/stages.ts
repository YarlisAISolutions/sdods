/**
 * The first-run install, described as stages and steps.

 * two can never disagree about what the steps are or what order they come in.
 *
 * The percentages are weighted by how long each stage actually takes, not by step count — the two
 * npm installs dominate wall-clock time, so giving every stage an equal slice would park the bar
 * at 40% for most of the wait and then jump.
