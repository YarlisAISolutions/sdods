          sdods.com and docs.sdods.com are static pages served by Firebase Hosting. They set no
          cookies and load no third-party scripts. The only thing stored in your browser is your
          light/dark theme preference, in local storage. Firebase Hosting keeps standard server logs
          (IP address, user agent, requested path) for a limited time, as any web host does.

              sdods.com counts page views and clicks on a few buttons (install, docs, copying a
              command) so we can tell whether a change to the site helped. Each event carries the
              page path, the referring site without its path, the window width and a random id that
              lives in memory for one tab and is gone when you reload. No cookies, no local storage,
              no fingerprinting, no session recording and no profile of you. Events are sent to
              PostHog, our analytics processor. If your browser sends Global Privacy Control or Do
              Not Track, nothing is sent at all.
