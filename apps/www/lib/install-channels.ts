/**
 * Every way SDODS can be installed, and which of them are actually usable right now.
 *
 * sdods.com is a static export, so it cannot ask npm, GHCR or GitHub at request time — and doing
 * it at build time would make every site deploy depend on three third parties being up. So the
 * channel list is a committed fact, refreshed by `scripts/sync-channels.ts`, which resolves each
 * one against the real registry before writing it here.
 *
 * `live: false` is a real, supported state, not a placeholder. A channel is only live once the
 * thing it points at exists: the npm package is published, the Homebrew tap has the formula, the
 * image is pushed and public, the release the manifests reference is out of draft. The install
 * page renders live channels only — a tab whose command 404s is worse than a missing tab, because
 * the visitor blames the tool rather than the page.
