/**
 * Sponsorship through Stripe Payment Links. The site is a static export with no backend, so every
 * option is a plain outbound link to Stripe Checkout; nothing here is a secret.
 *
 * This is the only place in the repo that holds Stripe URLs. The README, installer, CLI, web UI
 * and desktop app all link to SPONSOR_URL instead, so a price or link can change with a site
 * deploy and no release.
 *
 * The links belong to the "SDODS Developers" Stripe account. Leave a URL empty until its link
 * exists: while any is empty the page shows only the "large sponsorship" email card and the nav
 * and footer hide the ask. Fill all of them in at once (tests/sponsor.test.ts rejects a half-filled
 * set).
 *
 * Nothing here shows at all while SPONSOR_ENABLED (in @sdods/contracts/sponsor) is false: the
 * sponsor pages are not found and every link to them is hidden. Flip it with the links.
